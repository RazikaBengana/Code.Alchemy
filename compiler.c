/**
 * compile_file - program that compiles a source file into an executable or binary format
 *
 * this function handles the entire process of compiling a source file;
 * it begins by creating a compile process instance with specified parameters;
 * if the process creation fails, it returns an error;
 * the function then proceeds through various stages of compilation:
 * lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation;
 * the final result of this compilation process is determined by the success of these stages
 *
 * @filename: the name of the source file to be compiled
 * @out_filename: the name of the output file to be generated
 * @flags: integer flags used to control various aspects of the compilation process
 *
 * Return: - COMPILER_FILE_COMPILED_OK if the compilation is successful,
 * 	   - or COMPILER_FAILED_WITH_ERRORS if any stage of the compilation process fails
